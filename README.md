    <h2>About the Band</h2>
     <div id="About the Band"></div>
	  
  <font size="5">  
    <p>Fall Out Boy was created in 2001 in a suburb of Chicago, IL. The band consists of 4 members; Pete Wentz- the bassist and lyricist, Patrick Stump- the guitarist and lead vocalist, Andy Hurley- the drummer, and Joe Trohman- the lead guitarist. The original two members of the band were Pete Wentz and Joe Trohman. They went through several itterations of the band before finalizing the four members we have today. Patrick Stump never saw himself as much of a vocalist but with Pete's encouragement he decided to train his voice and gain the confidence to become the band's lead singer. The name Fall Out Boy was on a lengthy list of band name options and stems from a less commonly known Simpsons Character. It was only after other bands in the same music scene began referring to them as "Fall Out Boy" that the name stuck. Since 2001, the band has released eight studio albums, been nominated for several Grammys and MTV Music Awards and have sold over 8 billion albums globally.   </p>
